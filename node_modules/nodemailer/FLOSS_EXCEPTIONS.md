# 1\. Exception Intent

We want people to be able to build Free/Libre and Open Source Software ("FLOSS") applications using Nodemailer despite the fact that not all FLOSS licenses are compatible with version 1.1 of the European Union Public License (the "EUPL").

# 2\. Terms and Conditions

## 2.1 Definitions

- Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in the EUPL.
- "Library" means Nodemailer for which this exception is applicable.
- "Derivative Work" means derivative works as defined by EU copyright legislation.

## 2.2 Additional Grant

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 1.1 of the EUPL:

You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely from the Library and one or more works (each, a "FLOSS Work") licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in section 5, as long as:

- You obey the EUPL in all respects for the Library and the Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived from the Library, and which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves
- All identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived from the Library, and which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves, are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and
- The object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for those sections on the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as the corresponding object code or executable forms of those sections, and
- Any works which are aggregated with the Library or with a Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance with the EUPL, can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves which are not derivatives of either the Library, a Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.

## 3\. Applicability

This exception applies to Nodemailer version 3.0.0 or later, MailParser 2.0.0 or later released under the EUPL that contain a notice placed by Kreata OÃœ saying that Derivative Works built using the Library may be distributed under the terms of this Exception.

## 4\. Termination

If you fail to comply with any of the terms in this Exception then all rights granted to you herein are void and your rights immediately revert back to those granted in the EUPL v1.1.
